# ü§ñ Chat with Your Context ‚Äì A Context-Aware Conversational Agent

## üöÄ Overview

**Chat with Your Context** is an intelligent chatbot that delivers **accurate, context-aware answers** by understanding whether the user has provided enough information ‚Äî and retrieving additional data when necessary.

Unlike traditional bots with static responses, this agent **autonomously decides how to respond** by leveraging a smart architecture built with **LangChain's React Agent**. Whether you're asking a simple question or referencing complex documents, the agent tailors its responses using dynamic context management.

## üß† How It Works

At the heart of this system lies a **LangChain React Agent**, capable of reasoning through conversation flow and dynamically selecting tools to accomplish tasks. Here's what the chatbot does:

1. üîç **Context Validation**  
   Determines whether the user has provided enough context to answer the question.

2. üåê **Autonomous Context Retrieval**  
   If necessary, it performs a **web search** to gather missing or supplementary information.

3. üßæ **Context Relevance Check**  
   Analyzes provided or retrieved context to determine its **applicability** to the question.

4. ‚úÇÔ∏è **Context-Question Segregation**  
   Separates **user context** from the **main question**, ensuring accurate processing.

5. üí° **Informed Answer Generation**  
   Combines everything above to deliver a **reliable and grounded answer**.

These capabilities are built with modular **LangChain Tools**, enabling scalable and reusable components for future enhancements.
